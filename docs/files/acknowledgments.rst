Acknowledgments
===============

**Pyrough** relies on a few libraries (ASE, Atomsk, gmsh, **etc.**), and their authors are warmly acknowledged.

The foundations of **Pyrough** are based on early discussions with Dr. Javier-Antonio Gonzalez-Joa at MATEIS, INSA-Lyon. 
He helped me nurture the idea, and together we supervised the first internship related to the code. 
In that context, I would like also to thank Jennifer Izaguire, Benjamin Goument, Dr. Christophe Le-Bourlot (sphere object) and Dr. Joel Lachambre for their help with **Pyrough** first lines of code. 

My heartfelt thanks to Dr. Hugo Iteney with whom we developed the first stable and official version of the code.

Finally, I would also like to thant Anastasiia Walrave (IM2NP, AMU) and Gael Huynh (ILM, Univ. Lyon 1) for their contribution to **Pyrough**.
